    "Scorpion_1_1 successMessagetext": "Well shit, I didn't expect you to come back alive. Good work - I'm hearin' rumblings about where my guy might have gone off to. I'll send you on your way for now. Come back in a few. Take this for your trouble.",

    "Scorpion_1_3 description": "Those ambulances you tracked for us earlier? One of 'em is on the move. It looks like it's headed to the coast. See if you can get there first and clear out some of the local life to make spotting the ambulance a bit safer.",

    "Scorpion_1_4 description": "My guys spotted the ambulance headed to the Sanatorium! It looks like some of the locals may have moved back to the Sanitorium when you cleaned them out the other day, so you might have to prepare for a fight to get to that ambulance. See what you can find out and let me know.",
    "Scorpion_1_4 startedMessageText": "Get your ass up there and see what you can find out!",
    "Scorpion_1_4 successMessagetext": "My guys heard a lot of gunfire coming from the Sanatorium while you were out there, so I'm surprised you made it out.

    "Scorpion_1_5 description": "We inspected that flash drive before we gave it to you, I hope you came to the same conclusion that we did. We have to set up cameras at the factory. One for each entrance/exit should be good enough to try and catch some movement. Go at night so you aren't spotted. Find out who is going through there so we can keep making progress to finding them.",
    "Scorpion_1_5 startedMessageText": "You can buy a few cameras from my stock. I ain't givin' these away for free, tech is too pricy in Tarkov. Sorry bud.",

    "Scorpion_2_2 successMessagetext": "We should have known this was a dead end, random intelligence - my ass! I'll let you know when I've got a new lead to track down. Thanks for risking your rear, I know Reshala likes to hang out around there and that group ain't easy to deal with.",

One of my guys came back from a supply run, broken and bruised - yet they have spread all over the region. What cowards. Let's taunt them right back. Track them down, go find them anywhere you can, and shoot them in the face, but do it from up close for good measure. I want them to see the whites of your eyes. 10 casualties ought to be enough, they don't want this smoke.",
